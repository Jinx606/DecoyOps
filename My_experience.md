Throughout the creation of this particular project, i have run into a million and one pitfalls. i have 10 million deployments, pull requests you name it.
What i can say is that even though this is all quite extensive and i know i am in my early development stages, all of these small changes and annoyances on my part have taught me how to keep on pushing.
i know this project iis not nearly as close to done as I want to to the standards i try to set for myself but what i can say is that i am tenascious enough to never stop trying
